Is the U.S. government limiting how many individuals are allowed to enter the United States under these processes?,\nThe U.S. government will provide travel authorization for up to 30,000 individuals to come to the United States each month across the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan parole processes. This allows for a steady pace of operations and arrivals of individuals seeking parole. DHS removed the prior 24,000 limit on Venezuelan beneficiaries to conform with this new approach.,\nThe U.S. government is implementing these comprehensive efforts to reduce the irregular migration of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, to lawfully and safely bring qualifying individuals into the United States on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. DHS is not setting a limit on the overall number of beneficiaries or anticipated duration of these processes at this time and will continue to monitor the processes and their impact.,\nQ2. If I am paroled into the United States through these processes, what happens when my 2-year period of parole ends?,\nThere are a full range of existing lawful immigration pathways, including an extension of parole, immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, asylum, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), that certain parolees may be eligible for in accordance with U.S. laws.,\nFor more information on the process for applying as a Supporter, please visit this page on the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services website,\nthis page ,(https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-processes-for-cubans-haitians-nicaraguans-and-venezuelans)\nInterfaith-RISE is a program of the Reformed Church of Highland Park Affordable Housing corporation, a non-profit, 501(c)3 organization that provides affordable housing, supportive services, and connection to meaningful community to low-income individuals and families in central New Jersey.
