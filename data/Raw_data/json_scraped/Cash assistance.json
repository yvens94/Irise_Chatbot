RCA is available to any refugee, asylee or parolee that is single or married without minor children and is eligible for RSS services. Once connected with our agency and approved, you’ll begin receiving funds starting from the date of initial contact with our agency. ,\nThe goal of the RCA team is to assist with the first year of arrival to the US and to help equip clients with the skills they need to find employment, or other means of income, and become independent. As such, our program has requirements and monthly redeterminations in employment services, government assistance and English language classes that will help prepare clients for their future in the US. None of our process is done alone – with the help of an assigned case manager, any questions or concerns you may have will only be a phone call or email away.,\nEligibility:  You MUST be an established I-RISE client before you can be assessed for RCA.  Please call 732-357-0590 or email info@interfaithrise.org ,\ninfo@interfaithrise.org ,(mailto:info@interfaithrise.org)\nDo I qualify for RCA?,\nWhat can I/should I bring on the day of appointment?,\nPlease refer to the Refugee, CHE or Asylee information below for required documents,\nDo I qualify as a Refugee?,\nA refugee is any person who is outside their country of nationality or, is outside of the country of their last residence, who is unable or unwilling to return to their country, and is unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of:,\nRefugees are eligible to receive ORR (Office of Refugee Resettlement) benefits and services from their date of arrival in the U.S,\nWhat can I/should I bring on the day of appointment?,\nDo I qualify as a Cuban/Haitian Entrant?,\nYou may qualify as a Cuban/Haitian Entrant if you are a Cuban or Haitian national that is:,\nWhat can I/should I bring on the day of appointment?,\nProof of your eligibility as a Cuban/Haitian Entrant and the date you received it,\nTypes of proof include: ,\nCHE’s can qualify for 3 types of cash assistance: SSI, TANF or RCA,\nYou will have to choose the program that you feel is best for you.  You can only be enrolled in one program at a time, and may not qualify for all of them,\nDo I qualify as an asylee?,\nAn asylee is a person who has fled his or her country and is unable or unwilling to return due to persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on:,\nAn individual is granted asylum either by:,\nWhat can I/should I bring on the day of appointment?,\nYou should bring proof of your status and the date you received that status.
